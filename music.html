        <p>You know what I like, music. I think it's really hard to describe how people feel about music though. 
            But I think what I like about music is that it makes me feel things I wouldn't otherwise, mainly I think 
            it makes me feel human in a way nothing else does. I think I also like how it's other people's stories, 
            and that music expresses the way they feel pretty perfectly. I think it's nice listening to what other 
            people feel and actually feeling what they feel too. I like that it can make me happy or sad. I like that 
            I can just listen and forget myself. I like how it can be interpreted to meet other people's needs. I like 
            how even though I try to explain how I feel about it I can't. I don't think it's indescribable, 
            I just think it's different, and you can never convey the whole picture. I like how it's helped me and helps
             me. And I like how it's always been something I've known I've liked even when everything else around me is 
            changing. Also, I like how I'm not the only one who feels this way about it, I like how other people can 
            feel these things too.</p>
