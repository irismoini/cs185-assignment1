            <p> "I think it is brave that you get up in the morning when your heartaches and your 
                life is messy and you do not feel like being soft for the world. I think it is brave 
                that you continue to love, and express, and open your soul, despite the way you were 
                treated in the past. I think that it is brave that you keep going, that you keep believing 
                in something more, something bigger, even when you may not know what you are hoping for. I 
                think it is brave that you fight, I think it is brave that you choose, every single day, to 
                move forward-- because that is what makes you strong-- that is what makes you strong."

            <p>Self Growth</p>
            <p>1.) keeping your promises</p>
            <p>2.) maintaining boundaries</p>
            <p>3.) stepping out of your comfort zone</p>
            <p>4.) being present</p>
            <p>5.) being authentic</p>
            <p>6.) letting go of other's expectations</p>
            <p>7.) seeking deep connection</p>
