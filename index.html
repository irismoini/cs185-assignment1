                My name is Iris (she/her/hers) and I&#39m a third year CS major at UCSB. 
                I&#39m excited to be taking this course and to be learning as much as I 
                can about Human Computer Interaction. I don&#39t have a lot of 
                experience designing user interfaces, but would love to learn more! 
                A little about me--I&#39m a WomxnHacks board member and am extremely 
                excited to be a part of a board that works toward creating a safe and 
                supportive environment for women to learn about and engage with 
                programming. I have a passion for helping others learn how to code, 
                especially those who have no experience with it, and am a peer mentor 
                for the CS lower division courses at UCSB. In my spare time I love 
                creating and admiring art, as well as listening to music. I like to 
                snowboard when I can and go to the beach. Mostly, I love meeting new 
                people and listening to new and different perspectives! :)
